/* HOW TO USE:
1. paste the whole script
2. write one of the following to call the functions:

--fun--
stalk() - ties you to a player number
say() - globally says something in-game
suicide() - by far the most useful function

--utility--
health() - makes your health infinite
rankcheck() - checks your rank
ver() - tells you the current version
posXY() - tells you your X and Y position
players() - tells how many players there are in the world
grav() - change gravity to a specified number (superjump!)

--special--
telex(number) - teleport left or right
teley(number) - teleport up or down

--news--
Version 1.1:
# functions are now categorized (fun: not-so-serious functions) (utility: useful functions) (special: unique functions)
# some functions were removed/changed/transformed:
# script was reorganized for better readability
  -"dox" was removed because it is unnefficient and useless compared to network profile checking
  -"spam" was turned into say() because it was a weak and useless kind of spam
  -"stalk" was changed due to complaints
# some function descriptions in the HOW-TO section were changed for better understandability
